# Explanation of "Method 01"

**Method 01** is a roulette strategy discovered by watching a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pe1TskP2Awo).  
The method uses the **rectangular view of the roulette table**.

## How It Works
- You bet **€15 on black**, so that if you win, you get **double the amount bet (x2)**).
- Simultaneously, you bet **€10 on the final square of the top row** (using the rectangular view of the roulette table), which corresponds to the row containing the numbers **3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36**.  
  - This is because there are only **four black numbers in the first row**, and the strategy aims to exploit this anomaly.
  - Note: You are **not betting €10 on each number in the first row**, but only on the **final square of the first row**, so that if you win, you get **three times the amount bet (x3) **.
- At the same time, you **do not bet anything on the number 0**.

## Key Points
- The method is **relatively safe but not 100% reliable**, as evidenced by the fact that the **0 is always uncovered**.
- This strategy is useful when you are **already at a loss** and want to try to recover at least some of your losses, as it has proven effective in helping to **bounce back from critical situations**.
